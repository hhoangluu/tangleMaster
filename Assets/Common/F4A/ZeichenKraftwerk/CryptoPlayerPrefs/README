 Thanks for purchasing the CryptoPlayerPrefs class for Unity3D!

The CryptoPlayerPrefs class is an alternative for the PlayerPrefs class, by adding cryptography.
Thus, it is possible to secure sensitive data and protect them from game modification and cheating.
It is capable of using the Advanced Encryption Standard (Rijndael Algorithm) (default activated).
It also offers an XOR-option, to make the values "unreadable" for humans (default activated).

=== How to use? ===
You can use the CryptoPlayerPrefs class just like the PlayerPrefs class, just Replace PlayerPrefs by CryptoPlayerPrefs.

But it is recommended to set the salt for every application indivudally via the CryptoPlayerPrefs.setSalt(int) Method.
Or you can also use the CryptPlayerPrefsManager to set this setting in the editor.
You can even activate / deactivate Rijndael and the XOR seperately.
But in order to maximize security of the data it should be left as default.

ATTENTION: 
When you released a productive version of your application don't change settings anymore (or think about migration BEFORE!)
If you change it the cryptographie will be messed up and the keys won't work anymore etc..
A Mono.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricTransform.ThrowBadPaddingException would be thrown.
Therefore: Set these settings ONCE and don't change them anymore!

= Example =
PlayerPrefs.HasKey("coins") => CryptoPlayerPrefs.HasKey("coins")
PlayerPrefs.SetInt("coins", 1000) => CryptoPlayerPrefs.SetInt("coins", 1000)
and so on...

There is also an Example Scene which uses the CryptoPlayerPrefs class.
It has a bouncy ball which collides with boxes and everytime a collision occured it is saved according to the box. 

= CryptoPlayerPrefsX =
We've added a adjusted version of ArrayPrefs2 (http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/ArrayPrefs2), so you can use these additional features in a crypted way.
Therewith you can save arrays and other stuff.

=== Limitations ===
You must not use the stripping level 3 (Android / iOS)!
The CryptoPlayerPrefs class relies on the System.Security component and this is not included in the micro mscorlib.
Stripping level 0-2 works fine (if you use the given link.xml).
